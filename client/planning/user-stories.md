# Planning Phase 

## User Stories

- As a potential user I can register for an account because I want to create a list of games
- As a user I can log into my account because I want to add to and edit my games list.
- As a user I can search for a game that I would like to add to my personal list because I would like to track my status with relation to the game.
- As a user I can add games to my own personal list marked as <span style="color:green">**COMPLETED**</span>  because I have beat the game.
- As a user I can add games to my own personal list marked as <span style="color:gold">**PLAYING**</span> because it is one of the games I am currently trying to complete.
- As a user I can add games to my own personal list marked as <span style="color:red">**DROPPED**</span> because I have played the game but did not enjoy it and do not intend to play it again.
- As a user I can add games to my own personal list marked as <span style="color:skyblue">**ON HOLD**</span> because I played the game but will continue it another time because another game has captured my interest.

- As a user I can rate each game on my list on a scale of **1-10** based on how much I enjoyed it.

## Stretch Goal User Stories
- *Stretch* => As a user I can see other user lists because I am interested in seeing what games they are playing, have put on hold, have completed, and have dropped. I will also be able to see their scores 
- *Stretch* => As user I can see the average of all user scores about the game because I can take the score into consideration when deciding if I would like to play the game.
